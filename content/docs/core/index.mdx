## Philosophy

FEYNMAN approaches productivity management through the integration of user context with AI capabilities. Context management is used to align workflows and preferences with AI assistance, creating a productivity system that can effectively adapt to individual work patterns.

The different aspects of work processes are unified into one platform. This integration allows tasks and information to be managed in a cohesive environment with reduced context loss between separate tools.

## Why FEYNMAN?

FEYNMAN was created as an open source alternative that focuses on context management rather than traditional productivity approaches. Modules are treated as interconnected elements rather than separate entities.


## When to use FEYNMAN?

While FEYNMAN can function as a standalone productivity suite, it is best operated by integrating with existing tools and workflows. A rich MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is exposed that enables integration with other applications and services.

When connected with other applications, FEYNMAN can provide a broader view of productivity patterns by drawing insights from context across different tools and platforms.
