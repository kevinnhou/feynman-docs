## Transforming Task Management

> Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.

Tasks often feel mundane but they're essential. Every small effort, repeated consistently, builds momentum toward more significant goals. While they may seem trivial in the moment, these tasks shape our growth over time.

<span className="font-medium">FEYNMAN</span> is designed to help you break down complex tasks and problems into clear, actionable steps. Instead of just telling you what needs to be done, FEYNMAN helps you understand why it matters and how to approach it. By giving you a clear view of the underlying structure of a task, it enpowers you to identify patterns and potential challenges before they hinder your productivity.

## Managing Deadlines

FEYNMAN helps you stay ahead of your responsibilities by making it easy to track what’s due and when. With clear timelines, you can see which tasks require immediate attention and which ones can wait — helping you avoid last-minute stress and missed deadlines.

While some are <span className="italic font-bold">urgent</span>, requiring immediate attention, others can be <span className="italic font-extralight">low priority</span> and can be delayed or worked on concurrently. FEYNMAN supports dynamic scheduling by helping you recognise what needs to happen first and what can run in parallel, so you're always moving forward purposefully.

## Integration

### Notes

You can link tasks to your [notes](/core/notes) for richer context. This allows you to quickly reference relevant information and insights that support the task at hand.

### Sessions

Link tasks to focused [sessions](/core/sessions) to create clear work blocks. This structured approach ensures that you’re dedicating uninterrupted time to important tasks.
